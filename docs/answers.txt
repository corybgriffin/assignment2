Branches are used to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.
Branching is used in version control and software management to maintain stability while isolated
changes are made to code. Branching facilitates the development of bug fixes, the addition of 
new capabilities and the integration of new versions after they have been tested in isolation.

The git log command displays committed snapshots. It lets you list the project history, filter it,
and search for specific changes. While git status lets you inspect the working directory and the 
staging area, git log only operates on the committed history.

git log --follow -- Vehicle.h

git log --all --grep='file'

Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.
The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. Polymorphism is a 
feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of 
different types at different times. Polymorphism is the ability of a programming language to present 
the same interface for several different underlying data types. Encapsulation refers to the bundling 
of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit. Many programming 
languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes.

With the Integration manager workflow, each developer makes push to his/her own public repository
and pull from the blessed/central repository. With the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, only
the dictator can push to the blessed central repository. Developers push changes to the lieutenants,
lieutenants push them to the dictator, and the dictator pushes them to the blessed/central repository.

10.
With the centralized workflow, each developer has to pull any changes in the central repository and 
resolve conflicts before pushing back to that repository. With the dictator and lieutenants workflow,
they would just push their changes to the lieutenant, the lieutenant would solve any conflicts, the 
lieutenant would push the changes to the dictator and the dictator would resolve conflict. The 
dictator would then push the changes.
